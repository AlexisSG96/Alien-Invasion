Project: Alien Invasion

The purpose of this project was to follow a step by step instruction book on how to
build a game using python. The game in question was a replica of an old treasured game
"Space Invaders". During the process, the book informed us on how to do numerous things.
For example, chapter 12 was about installing pygame, creating a project, adding ship 
images, programing the ship to move, and adding the ability to shoot bullets. Chapter 13,
exapnded on some topics by helping us creating a fleet of moving aliens that change 
direction before moving out of bound. More importantly, the chapter demonstrated how
to create a collision function between the aliens, ship, and bullets. This function
allowed for destroying aliens or dying when they make contact with the ship. The final
chapter guides us in making a play button to begin the game, a trick to hiding the mouse,
and creating a scoreboard to keep track of high scores and the number of ships remaining.
